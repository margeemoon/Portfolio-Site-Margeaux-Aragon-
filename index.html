      <!-- open paragraph -->
      I’m a UI/ UX and Product Designer with a background in food, specializing in baking and pastry. I
      spent most of my career leading multiple teams of young pastry cooks, executing menus designed by
      myself with the collaboration of my colleagues. I have worked for some of the biggest names in
      food and my greatest achievement was a published recipe in Nancy Silverton's Mozza at Home cookbook! Because
      of my love for food, I found a love for traveling. Going to different countries, cities, provencial towns
      and eating my way through it's culture is one of my most favorite things to do! I think food and what
      I have learned from my experiences is at the heart of my design solutions.
      I have a passion for teaching, creating, and pleasing a multitude of palates. With my previous
      experience as a leader, I would make a great addition to any team. I understand the need for
      oranization, procedure, testing, communication, and learning. The same
      principles apply to my role as a UI/UX Designer, I need to know the process of the inventions in order to optimize the product.

              For this project I used pen and paper to create low-fidelity wireframes. Then Sketch to build mid-fidelity frames; a prototype using InVision was created to conduct user testing to complete a set of two tasks. From there, the
              highh-fidelity
              wireframes were created and finished again, in Sketch.

          <h3>Talk Talk</h3><!-- heading for the project -->
          <p>
            <!-- open paragraph -->
            I began my research by reviewing other messaging apps. Predominantly Facebook Messanger. I
            loved the simplicity but I wanted to make my app a bit more simple with a fun design. Then I found a
            design on Dribbble by a designer called SoLemon that I wanted to mimic and Talk Talk was born.
          </p>

            <!-- open paragraph -->
            For this project, I started to design immediately. I did not sketch out any wireframes nor did I begin this process
            in the traditional sense. I thought of this task as a fun refresher after creating an extensive to-do list
            wallet app so instead, I had fun and went straight to Sketch and started to play around. From there, I
            created a UI kit containg reusable UI elements and typography for any future iterations and new screen developments from my team.
